# Data Encoding

For all demographic variables, numbers in the postfix indicate the year the variable was collected (year 2013 or year 2014). For example, bonus_13 means the bonus of the year 2013 for this individual.

For communication variables, the prefix indicates whether they are absolute numbers or percentages. The postfix indicates whether the variable is for overall communications (total), same-legacy communications (within), or across-legacy communications (across). For example, num_email_total means the overall number of emails exchanged by the individual.
